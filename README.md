_Dante_ is a C-based C-like language which employs the italian language in its syntax.

The code is read, its tokens are replaced and it is transpiled in C.

This means that
1. The Dante Transpiler can generate a C source file from a Dante file
2. You can write normal C code inside Dante source files and it will work just fine: inter-operability is a big plus
3. You may compile a Dante program existing any widely used C compiler
